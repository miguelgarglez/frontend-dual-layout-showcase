# Frontend Dual Layout Showcase

This repository is a portfolio-ready frontend case study focused on **UI architecture, responsive design, and component quality**.  
The project demonstrates how I built and structured two complete experiences from a design challenge:

1. **Desktop dashboard layout** with modular sections, shared UI primitives, and route-based navigation.
2. **Mobile-first request flow** with progressive form steps, custom interactive controls, and accessibility-focused behavior.

## Why this project is relevant

- Real-world component composition with React 19 + TypeScript.
- Token-driven styling with Tailwind CSS v4.
- UI behavior covered with unit/component tests (Vitest + Testing Library).
- Clear separation of concerns across `pages`, `components`, `hooks`, and `lib`.
